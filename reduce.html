  <h1> reduce</h1>

  `std::reduce/std::transform_reduce` are two algorithms consistenlty vectorized
  by clang<br />
  (regardless of the shape of the call - it can be written by hand or via
  std::accumulate). <br />
  Because of this there is no scalar baseline.
  <br /> <br />
  There are two interesting variations on reduce:<br />
  a) We are reducing to the same type as the element type. <br />
  b) We are reducing to a bigger type to deal with a potential overflow.
  <br />

  <h2> Reducing to the same type </h2>

  This is relatively straight forward.<br />
  The best results is achived when unrolling 4 times. <br />
  In this case we are consistenlty massively winning - at most 7 times for 1000
  bytes of chars. <br />
  I don't know why the big difference in behaviour of `std::reduce` - the
  assembly looks <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/tskjMs">identical</a> <br />
  and I'm controlling for code alignment. <br />
  The only idea I have is that punishment for loop peeling for chars is this
  big, <br />
  I have seen mutliple times quite poor perfromance of scalar code for chars.
  <br /><br />
  With respect to code alignment, `unsq_eve` version cares very little - at most
  10% for 1000 bytes. <br />
  `std::reduce` - not so lucky - at 10k swings up to 44% and this does not seem
  to be the scalar code's code fault. <br />

  <h2> Reducing to a different type </h2>

  When reducing to a different type, we need to somehow convert from the array
  type, to <br />
  they type we want to do our operations in. <br />
  `std::reduce` for this generates a really nice <a
    href="https://godbolt.org/z/fXLh8T">assembly</a> <br />
  (chars reducing to shorts).

  <br /><br />
  ```<br />
  vpmovsxbw ymm4, xmmword ptr [rdi + rdx] <br />
  vpaddw ymm0, ymm0, ymm4<br />
  vpmovsxbw ymm4, xmmword ptr [rdi + rdx + 16]<br />
  vpaddw ymm1, ymm1, ymm4<br />
  vpmovsxbw ymm4, xmmword ptr [rdi + rdx + 32]<br />
  ```
  <br /><br />

  This is essentially: `_mm_cvtepi8_epi16 ` called directly on the address -
  <br />
  There is no intrinsic to do this, but I'll to try to make the compiler
  generate it for me. <br />

  What I do instead is load the whole register and then do `eve::convert` to an
  emulated register. <br />
  This is not free. (I only measured for chars to shorts/ints). <br />
  For char/short we loose everywhere except for 40 bytes, because `unsq_eve`
  doesn't peel loops. <br />
  For chars/int every option is roughly the same, but we could've been getting a
  nicer assembly <br />
  All of the attempts to unroll on top are useless <br />
