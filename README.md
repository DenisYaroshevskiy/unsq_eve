# Benchmarks for [EVE library](https://github.com/jfalcou/eve)

This repo for most part now contains benchmarks for algorithms in [EVE  library](https://github.com/jfalcou/eve).
(Plus some things I did not upstream yet/or that I shouldn't really upstream).

The results can be found [here](https://denisyaroshevskiy.github.io/unsq_eve/).

## What happened to the algoithms

Most of the algorithms are upstreamed and are ported across different architectures. They are now in [eve/algo](https://github.com/jfalcou/eve/tree/develop/include/eve/algo).
